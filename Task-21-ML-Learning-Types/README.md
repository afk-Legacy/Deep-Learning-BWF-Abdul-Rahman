# Four Branches of Machine Learning

This text describes the four main branches of machine learning:

- Supervised Learning:
  - It involves learning to map input data to known targets using a set of examples.
  - It includes binary classification, multiclass classification, and scalar regression.
  - Some exotic variants of supervised learning include sequence generation, syntax tree prediction, object detection, and image segmentation.
  - This is the most common form of machine learning, and most applications of deep learning today belong to this category.

- Unsupervised Learning:
  - It involves finding interesting transformations of input data without targets.
  - It's used for data visualization, data compression, or data denoising.
  - It's often used as a step to better understand a dataset before attempting to solve a supervised-learning problem.
  - Dimensionality reduction and clustering are well-known categories of unsupervised learning.

- Self-Supervised Learning:
  - It is a specific instance of supervised learning, but it doesn't require human-annotated labels.
  - Instead, labels are generated from the input data using a heuristic algorithm.
  - Examples of self-supervised learning include autoencoders, predicting the next frame in a video, and predicting the next word in a text.
  - This category blurs the line between supervised and unsupervised learning.

- Reinforcement Learning:
  - It involves training an agent to choose actions that will maximize some reward.
  - It has had significant success in games, but it is still mostly a research area.
  - Reinforcement learning has the potential to have a large range of real-world applications, such as self-driving cars, robotics, resource management, and education.

The categories of machine learning can overlap, and they form a continuum without clear borders. This book focuses primarily on supervised learning, with a brief overview of self-supervised learning.

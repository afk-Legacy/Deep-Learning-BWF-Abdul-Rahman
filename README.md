> Learned about Python functions, including docstrings, function definition, calling functions, passing arguments to functions, returning values, and working with arbitrary numbers of arguments.

---

### [:classical_building: Python Classes and Inheritance](https://github.com/afk-Legacy/Deep-Learning-BWF-Abdul-Rahman/tree/main/Task-8-Classes-Inheritance)
> Explored Python's class-based object-oriented programming paradigm, including defining classes, creating instances of classes, and working with inheritance.

---

### [:file_folder: Python File and Exception Handling](https://github.com/afk-Legacy/Deep-Learning-BWF-Abdul-Rahman/tree/main/Task-9-Files-Handling-Exception-Handling)
> Learned about reading and writing files in Python, as well as handling exceptions with try, except, and finally statements.

---

### [:chart_with_upwards_trend: Numpy Basics](https://github.com/afk-Legacy/Deep-Learning-BWF-Abdul-Rahman/tree/main/Task-10-Numpy-Basics)
> Explored the basics of the NumPy library in Python, including initializing arrays, array metadata, arithmetic operations on arrays, boolean and fancy indexing, and broadcasting.

---

### [:bar_chart: Numpy Linear Algebra](https://github.com/afk-Legacy/Deep-Learning-BWF-Abdul-Rahman/tree/main/Task-11-Numpy-Algebra)
> Learned about basic linear algebra and statistics functions implemented using Numpy. Some of the functions covered include mean, median, mode, rank, quantiles, probability distribution, correlation, transpose, determinant, inverse, eigenvalues, eigenvectors, dot product, cross product, and covariance.

---

### [:books: Numpy Broadcasting](https://github.com/afk-Legacy/Deep-Learning-BWF-Abdul-Rahman/tree/main/Task-12-Numpy-Broadcasting)
> Explored the concept of broadcasting in NumPy with 10 different examples. The examples showcased various broadcasting scenarios, such as adding a scalar to an array, multiplying arrays with different shapes, broadcasting along multiple dimensions, using a boolean array for broadcasting and even broadcasting with arrays of different data types.

---

### [:panda_face: Pandas Basics](https://github.com/afk-Legacy/Deep-Learning-BWF-Abdul-Rahman/tree/main/Task-13-Pandas-Basics)
> Learned about pandas, a Python library for data manipulation. It has two primary data structures, series and dataframes. Series are one-dimensional arrays with labeled data, while dataframes are two-dimensional tables with labeled rows and columns. Pandas offers efficient data processing and analysis capabilities.

---

### [:floppy_disk: Pandas Loading Data](https://github.com/afk-Legacy/Deep-Learning-BWF-Abdul-Rahman/tree/main/Task-14-Pandas-Reading-Files)
> Explored data loading with Pandas, which offers functions to load data from CSV, JSON, Excel, and SQL databases. These functions include read_csv(), read_json(), read_excel(), and read_sql(). Pandas simplifies data preprocessing, making it easy to analyze and explore data from different sources.


---

### [:chart_with_upwards_trend: Pandas Handling Data](https://github.com/afk-Legacy/Deep-Learning-BWF-Abdul-Rahman/tree/main/Task-15-Handling-Data)
> Learned about Handling Missing Data, Filling and Replacing Values, Removing Duplicates, Detecting and Removing Outliers

---

### [:jigsaw: Pandas Combining Data](https://github.com/afk-Legacy/Deep-Learning-BWF-Abdul-Rahman/tree/main/Task-16-Reshaping-Data)
> Learned about concatenating dataframes vertically, joining dataframes horizontally, pivoting a dataframe to convert rows into columns, melting a dataframe to combine multiple columns into one, and stack and unstack to reorganize multi-level index dataframes for the purpose of reshaping data.

---

### [:hammer: Mini Project - States Data](https://github.com/afk-Legacy/Deep-Learning-BWF-Abdul-Rahman/tree/main/Task-17-Mini-Project)
> Cleaned and analyzed census data in multiple CSV files to create scatterplots and histograms. Used pandas to load and manipulate data, converted columns to appropriate data types, split and converted columns with gender, and filled null values. Checked for duplicates and created histograms for race categories.

---
